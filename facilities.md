# Facilities Standards

This section establishes the minimum standards for pools hosting GPSA-sanctioned meets.

## Pool Length

1. The pool shall be 25 meters in length. If not, an appropriate correction factor shall be applied to times swum in the non-conforming pool.

    a. 25 yard pools shall use a conversion factor of 1.09.

    b. Colony pool shall use a conversion factor of 1.07.

## Required Equipment

1. All pools must have lane markings on the bottom, targets on the end walls in the center of each lane, lane ropes and backstroke flags in accordance with current USA Swimming Rules.

## Backstroke Flags

1. Backstroke flags shall be 5 meters or 5 yards (+/- 1 foot) from the end of the pool. Failure to have appropriately located backstroke flags will result in the home team forfeiting all Backstroke, Individual Medley, and Medley Relay events.

## Starting Platforms

**Note: This section contains both legacy GPSA requirements and current USA Swimming standards for committee review and decision.**

### Legacy GPSA Requirements

1. Starting requirements and block heights based on water depth at the starting end (measured 3 feet from the bulkhead):
    - In pools with water less than 3'6": Starts shall be from the water.
    - In pools with water 3'6" to less than 4': Starting blocks shall be no more than 18" above the water surface.
    - In pools with water 4' and more: Starting blocks shall be no more than 2'6" (30") above the water surface.

2. The platform must have a horizontal handgrip about 18 inches above the water.

3. The platform shall be marked with a lane number.

### USA Swimming Standards (2025)

1. Starting block maximum height: 0.75 meters (29.5 inches) above the water surface.

2. Water depth requirements for starting blocks:
    - Less than 4' depth: All swimmers must start from within the water (no blocks allowed).
    - 4' to 6' depth: Starting blocks allowed only for swimmers certified by a USA Swimming coach.
    - Greater than 6' depth: Starting blocks allowed for all swimmers.
