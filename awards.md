# Awards

This section defines the awards system for GPSA competitions.

## Meet Awards

1. The home pool shall award first (blue), second (red), and third (white) place ribbons for all individual events, and first place ribbons (blue) to all participants on winning relay teams.

2. The design of these ribbons will be at the discretion of the home pool.

3. Such awards shall be given to the Coaches or GPSA Representatives after the meet or mailed to the GPSA Representative the following day.

4. Additional ribbons for 4th place or participation may be awarded at the discretion of the home pool.

5. Any awards referencing disqualifications shall be given directly to the respective coach along with the disqualification slip and shall not be included with the regular meet awards.

## Division Awards

1. Trophies shall be awarded to the teams finishing 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in each division.

2. If two teams have identical records, then the winner of their dual meet shall get the top standing. If the tie cannot be resolved by head-to-head records, then the winner shall be determined by adding up total points scored by each team in dual meets against the other tied teams. For example, if teams A, B, and C each have identical records, add points scored for team A in meets against teams B and team C for team A's total. Similarly, add points for teams B and C. The team with the highest point total is the winner. The intent of adding points involving tied teams only is to discourage teams from running up point totals against weaker teams in case of a potential tie.

3. A banner will be awarded to the winning team in each division and the team winning the Championship Meet. The banners will be presented at the Championship Meet to the respective coaches. Teams winning the banners will bring them to the GPSA Board Meeting following the Championship Meet and turn them in for embroidering. The banners will be returned to the respective teams at the following meeting. All banners will be turned in to GPSA at least one week before the Championship Meet so that they are available for presentation at the meet. Lost or damaged banners will be replaced by the team having possession. Banners will be replaced and old banners retired by GPSA every 10 years.
