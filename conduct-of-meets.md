# Conduct of Interpool Meets

This section establishes the procedures and requirements for conducting GPSA dual meets.

## Scheduling and Postponements

1. **Start Time:** League scheduled meets are to be held as scheduled and will start at 6:00 pm. The meet is considered to have officially begun when the Referee signals the start of the first event.

2. **Warm-up Times:** Both teams shall be given equal warm-up time prior to the meet, with a minimum of 20 minutes per team. The home team shall warm-up first, followed by the visiting team. The Referee and both GPSA Representatives may agree to shorter warm-up periods when necessary.

3. **Meet Delays:** In the event of inclement weather or minor facility issues that arise before or during a meet, every effort should be made to run the meet as planned. The Referee and both GPSA Representatives shall confer and may temporarily delay the start or suspend the meet (e.g., in 30-minute increments) to await safe, competitive conditions.

4. **Postponement:** A meet that cannot be safely started or continued may be postponed.

    a. **Weather/Facility Postponement:** If conditions are clearly unsafe or the facility is unusable, the home team must notify the visiting team's GPSA Representative and the GPSA Publicity Committee as soon as possible.

    b. **Mutual Agreement:** A meet may be postponed at any time with the unanimous agreement of both teams' GPSA Representatives.

    c. **Referee Authority:** Once the meet has begun, the Referee may postpone the meet if, in their judgment, conditions are unsafe for competition.

5. **Rescheduling Process:**

    a. Upon postponement, the GPSA Representatives' first priority is to agree on a date to hold the meet as soon as reasonably possible (e.g., the next day).
    b. If an immediate alternative date cannot be mutually agreed upon, the meet shall be held on the next available official league rain date.
    c. A final, rescheduled date **must** be confirmed by both Representatives within 24 hours of the initial postponement.

6. **Defining a Completed Meet:**

    a. A meet that is stopped and cannot be resumed is considered **complete** if all events through event 30 (15-18 50M Breast) have been swum.
    b. If a meet is stopped before the completion of event 30, it is considered a **suspended meet** and must be rescheduled and completed at a later date.
    c. Notwithstanding the above, the two GPSA Representatives may mutually agree that a meet is complete at any point after it has begun.

7. **Failure to Reschedule:**

    a. The collaborative rescheduling of a suspended meet is a primary responsibility of both GPSA Representatives, who are expected to begin discussions on the night of the postponement.
    b. If the Representatives fail to agree on a reschedule date within the 24-hour period required by rule 5.c, the meet shall be declared a **loss for both teams.**

8. **Postponed Meet Entries:** In the event of a postponed swim meet, each team's entries shall remain unchanged and saved in Meet Maestro until the resumption of the meet. Changes may be made in accordance with the substitution rules.

## Venue and Code of Conduct

1. **Smoking and Alcohol Prohibition:** Neither smoking nor the consumption of alcoholic beverages will be allowed in the pool area during swim meets. The exact boundaries of this area will be determined by the Referee and both GPSA representatives.
2. **Behavioral Standards:** Profanity, vulgarity, or disruptive behavior will not be allowed.
3. **Recording Device Restrictions:** The use of any audio or visual recording devices, including cell phones, is strictly prohibited in changing areas, rest rooms, locker rooms, or behind the starting blocks.

4. **Suspended or Banned Individuals:** If an individual who is currently suspended or banned from GPSA activities attends a meet:

    a. The GPSA Representatives from both teams shall approach the individual and respectfully request that they leave the venue (beyond sight and sound of the meet).

    b. If the individual leaves voluntarily, the meet shall proceed normally.

    c. If the individual refuses to leave, the team to which the suspended or banned individual belongs shall forfeit the meet. Times recorded for swimmers from the forfeiting team shall not stand.

## Swimmer Participation and Entries

1. **Age Group Flexibility:** Swimmers are allowed to participate in any event in age groups older than their actual age.
2. **Individual Event Limits:** A swimmer is allowed to participate in no more than three (3) individual events and one (1) relay event (not including exhibition).

    b. For a team with fewer than 64 swimmers on its official roster, swimmers in an age/gender group with three (3) or fewer swimmers may compete in up to four (4) individual events.
    c. If a swimmer is found to have exceeded these limits, they shall be disqualified from all events in which they were entered, and scores shall be adjusted.
3. **Maximum Scoring Entrants:** Each team is allowed a maximum of two (2) entrants in any individual event and one (1) relay team in any relay event to be eligible for scoring. All other entrants from a team shall be marked as exhibition.

    a. *Example: If event 1 is in the water, no substitutions can be made in events 2, 3, and 4.*

2. **Submission Process:** Only the coach or coach's designated representative may approach the scoring table and present a written note bearing the event number, lane number, and name of the swimmer for the desired substitution.

3. **Postponed Meet Exception:** In the event of a postponed swim meet, substitutions may be made at the beginning of the restarted meet for all events not previously swum, in which case the three-event rule does not apply.

4. **Injury/Illness Exception:** The referee may allow substitution for an injured or sick swimmer outside the three-event window. In this case, the event counts as an event swum for both the original swimmer and the substituted swimmer.
