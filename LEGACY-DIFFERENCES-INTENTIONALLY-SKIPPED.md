# Legacy Rulebook Differences - Intentionally Skipped or Ignored

**Status:** Reference document for future review
**Date Created:** 2026-01-04
**Purpose:** Documents all differences between legacy and new rulebook that were intentionally skipped, ignored, or handled differently

This document serves as a historical record of decisions made during the legacy-to-new rulebook comparison process.

---

## 1. GENERAL Section

### 90% Passing Grade for Officials Test

**Legacy Text:**
> "Tests will be submitted to the Rules Committee for scoring. A grade of 90% or better will be considered passing."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Handled by new USA Swimming online courses

**Rationale:**
- USA Swimming online courses now have integrated testing
- Scoring is handled by USA Swimming, not GPSA Rules Committee
- No longer need to specify passing grade

**New Rulebook Coverage:** officials.md:188-190 (USA Swimming Online Course option)

---

### List of Qualified Officials Posted on Roster Web Page

**Legacy Text:**
> "A list of qualified officials will be posted on the team roster web page."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Existing language sufficient

**Rationale:**
- eligibility-and-rosters.md:11 already requires maintaining roster with certified officials listed
- "Maintain" implies availability/accessibility
- Adding "posting" requirement is overly specific about delivery method

**New Rulebook Coverage:** eligibility-and-rosters.md:11

---

## 2. TROPHIES AND BANNERS Section

**Decision:** No items skipped - 100% coverage achieved

---

## 3. ELIGIBILITY Section

### Specific Roster Submission Format and Email

**Legacy Text:**
> "An Athlete Roster report from SwimTopia in Team Manager format must be submitted by each GPSA team to rosters@gpsaswimming.org."

**Decision:** DEFERRED for future discussion - Added note in rulebook

**Rationale:**
- Specific email addresses and formats may change
- Too operational for rulebook
- Better suited for wiki/operational guide

**New Rulebook Coverage:** eligibility-and-rosters.md:15 (note added for future revision)

**Follow-up Needed:** Create wiki documentation for roster submission process

---

### Email Timestamp Reference for 24-Hour Rule

**Legacy Text:**
> "twenty-four hours (reference point is the email timestamp)"

**Decision:** DEFERRED for future discussion - Grouped with roster submission details

**Rationale:**
- Operational detail that may change with technology
- Part of broader roster submission process discussion

**New Rulebook Coverage:** eligibility-and-rosters.md:41 (note added for future revision)

**Follow-up Needed:** Clarify submission method and timestamp reference

---

## 4. TIME FOR MEETS Section

### 4:00 PM Notification Deadline for Weather Postponement

**Legacy Text:**
> "If weather is a concern, the teams must notify each other no later than 4:00 pm if the meet is to be postponed due to pool closure due to weather."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Kept "as soon as possible" language

**Rationale:**
- "As soon as possible" is more flexible
- Weather decisions may need to happen at various times
- 4:00 PM deadline too rigid for all scenarios

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:14 ("as soon as possible")

---

### Pool Management Discretion After Teams Arrive

**Legacy Text:**
> "If after the teams arrive at the meet location, the decision whether to swim is at the discretion of the pool management."

**Decision:** IGNORED - New language deemed sufficient

**Rationale:**
- conduct-of-meets.md:10-11 already covers meet delays/suspension authority
- Referee and GPSA Reps confer on safe conditions
- Pool management authority is implied in facility decisions

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:10-11

---

### Number of Rain Dates (One vs. Two)

**Legacy Text:**
> "there will be two open dates scheduled into each division schedule"

**Decision:** IGNORED - Singular "rain date" is acceptable

**Rationale:**
- Scheduling details handled administratively
- "Next available official league rain date" (singular) works whether there's one or multiple
- Schedule committee determines actual number of rain dates

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:22 ("next available official league rain date")

---

### "Meet Starts When Referee Blows Whistle"

**Legacy Text:**
> "The meet starts when the referee blows the whistle for the first event."

**Decision:** MODIFIED - Different but equivalent language added

**Rationale:**
- New language: "meet is considered to have officially begun when the Referee signals the start of the first event"
- Signal may be whistle, verbal, or hand signal
- More general language is better

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:7

---

## 5. OFFICIALS/EQUIPMENT Section

### USA Swimming Official Test Reference

**Legacy Text:**
> "Watch the USA Swimming Stroke and Turn/Meet Referee/Starter videos and take the open-book test."

**Decision:** MODERNIZED - Different certification methods now available

**Rationale:**
- USA Swimming now offers integrated online courses (not just separate videos + tests)
- New rulebook reflects current USA Swimming offerings
- Old "open-book test" no longer the standard method

**New Rulebook Coverage:** officials.md:184-192

---

## 6. ORDER OF EVENTS Section

### Individual Medley Stroke Order

**Legacy Text:**
> "The order of strokes for the individual medley is butterfly, back, breast, and any other stroke not previously swum (freestyle)."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Covered by USA Swimming reference

**Rationale:**
- order-of-events.md:28 references USA Swimming Articles 101.2-101.7
- Article 101.6 defines IM stroke order
- No need to duplicate

**New Rulebook Coverage:** order-of-events.md:28 (USA Swimming reference)

---

### Medley Relay Stroke Order

**Legacy Text:**
> "The order of strokes in the medley relay is backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and any other stroke not previously swum (freestyle)."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Covered by USA Swimming reference

**Rationale:**
- order-of-events.md:28 references USA Swimming Articles 101.2-101.7
- Article 101.7 defines medley relay stroke order
- No need to duplicate

**New Rulebook Coverage:** order-of-events.md:28 (USA Swimming reference)

---

### Exhibition Heats Language

**Legacy Text:**
> "Up to 5 exhibition heats per team must be allowed"

**New Text:**
> "A minimum of 5 exhibition heats per **Team** must be allowed"

**Decision:** KEPT NEW LANGUAGE - Improvement over legacy

**Rationale:**
- "Minimum of 5" guarantees at least 5 (stronger protection)
- "Up to 5" could be misread as a maximum
- New language is clearer and more protective of teams' rights

**New Rulebook Coverage:** order-of-events.md:36

---

## 7. MEET OPERATIONS Section

### Championship Meet Age Group Restriction

**Legacy Text:**
> "Swimmers are allowed to participate in any event in age group events older than their actual age **in interpool meets** but must swim within their actual age group, except relays, **in the Championship Meet**."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Championship Meet specific

**Rationale:**
- Rulebook focuses on dual meets
- Invitational meets (Championship, Mini Meet, Summer Splash) have their own meet invitations
- Meet invitations specify rule variations
- Not appropriate for dual meet rulebook

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:113 (dual meet rule only)

---

### Mini Meet and Championship Exemption for 4-Event Rule

**Legacy Text:**
> "This rule would not be applicable to either the Mini Meet or the GPSA Championship meet."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Invitational specific

**Rationale:**
- Same reasoning as above
- Invitational meet invitations handle their own rules
- Rulebook is for dual meets only

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:116 (dual meet rule only)

---

### Lane Slip Workflow Details

**Legacy Text:**
> [Detailed sweep judge procedures for marking places on lane slips, delivering to referee, etc.]

**Decision:** MODERNIZED - Updated to Meet Maestro workflow

**Rationale:**
- Legacy workflow was manual lane slips
- New workflow uses Place Judge Forms from Meet Maestro
- Cleaner, more modern process
- Legacy workflow still supported as optional

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:94-109 (modernized workflow)

---

## 8. STARTS Section

### Starting Equipment/Signals

**Legacy Text:**
> "Each event will be started by gun, sound, light or any combination."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Covered by USA Swimming Article 101.1

**Rationale:**
- USA Swimming Article 101.1.1 defines approved starting devices
- conduct-of-meets.md:119 references Article 101.1
- No need to duplicate

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:119 (USA Swimming reference)

---

### Starting Location (Block or Deck)

**Legacy Text:**
> "Events may be started from a starting block or the edge of the pool adjacent to the block."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Covered by USA Swimming Article 101.1

**Rationale:**
- USA Swimming Article 101.1.2-101.1.4 defines starting positions
- Includes blocks, deck, and in-water starts
- conduct-of-meets.md:119 references Article 101.1
- No need to duplicate

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:119 (USA Swimming reference)

---

## 9. SWIMMING STROKES AND DISQUALIFICATIONS Section

### USA Swimming Article 102.22 Reference

**Legacy Text:**
> "Disqualifications shall adhere to Article 102.22 of the USA Swimming Rules and Regulations in effect for the current year for all ages."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Detailed procedures already documented

**Rationale:**
- New rulebook has comprehensive DQ procedures throughout:
  - Stroke & Turn Judge duties (officials.md:95-99)
  - DQ slip processing (officials.md:55-61)
  - Scoring impact (scoring.md:19-21)
- Our procedures are more detailed than a simple reference
- Explicit procedures are more useful than a reference to external article

**New Rulebook Coverage:**
- officials.md:55-61 (DQ slip processing)
- officials.md:95-99 (S&T Judge reporting)
- scoring.md:19-21 (scoring impact)

---

## 10. SCORING Section

### Championship Meet Qualifying Times Pool Conversion Factors

**Legacy Text:**
> "Pools having less than 25 meters length shall apply the following multiplication conversion factors for Championship Meet qualifying times for all events: Colony 1.07 and Hidenwood/Wythe/Wendwood 1.09."

**Decision:** IGNORED - Already in facilities section

**Rationale:**
- Already covered in facilities.md:7-11
- Pool conversion factors listed by pool type
- Applies to all times, not just Championship qualifying
- Better placement in facilities section than scoring section

**New Rulebook Coverage:** facilities.md:7-11

---

### Publicity Report Details

**Legacy Text:**
> "Meet results are defined as a combination of the following:
> - Meet Maestro Team Scores report
> - Meet Maestro report with only first place finishers
> - Championship Meet Qualifying Times"

**Decision:** DEFERRED to wiki documentation

**Rationale:**
- Too operational/procedural for rulebook
- Report formats may change over time
- Better suited for wiki with screenshots and step-by-step instructions
- Rulebook kept general requirement (submit results within 24 hours)

**New Rulebook Coverage:** officials.md:23 (general requirement)

**Follow-up Needed:** Wiki page for publicity submission process

---

### Lane Slip Retention Period

**Legacy Text:**
> "The GPSA Representative shall keep the lane slips for the duration of the current season."

**Decision:** MODIFIED - Generalized to all meet artifacts

**Rationale:**
- New language covers lane slips AND all other meet records
- More comprehensive than legacy
- "Meet artifacts" includes: lane slips, Place Judge Forms, Sweep Judge sheets, Meet Referee sheets, DQ slips
- Better future-proofing

**New Rulebook Coverage:** officials.md:139

---

### Postponed Meet Entry Procedures

**Legacy Text:**
> "In the event of a postponed swim meet, each team's entries shall remain unchanged and saved in Meet Maestro until the resumption of the meet. Changes may be made in accordance with the rules described elsewhere."

**Decision:** ADDED (not skipped, but worth noting)

**Rationale:**
- Important operational detail
- Added to conduct-of-meets.md:36
- Ensures clarity on postponement entry handling

**New Rulebook Coverage:** conduct-of-meets.md:36

---

### Publicity Penalty Amount

**Legacy Text:**
> "the team may be assessed a penalty of 50 points for the next meet at the discretion of the Rules Committee"

**Decision:** MODIFIED - Removed specific point amount

**Rationale:**
- New language: "may result in penalties at the discretion of the Rules Committee"
- Gives Rules Committee flexibility
- 50 points may be too much or too little depending on circumstances
- Better to allow committee discretion

**New Rulebook Coverage:** officials.md:23

---

## 11. PROTESTS Section

**Decision:** No items skipped - 100% coverage achieved (even improved with additions)

---

## 12. DUTIES OF OFFICIALS Section

### Operational Items Deferred to Wiki

Many GPSA Representative operational duties were identified as better suited for wiki documentation rather than the rulebook. These are documented in `DUTIES-OF-OFFICIALS-TODO.md` but summarized here:

**Pre-Meet Conference Procedures:**
- Weather policies discussion
- Officials introduction between teams

**Equipment and Pool Setup:**
- Pre-season inspection of meet equipment

**General Operational Duties:**
- Assist in crowd control
- Observe officials during meet and note weaknesses

### Roster Submission Format and Email

**Status:** RESOLVED - Deferred to wiki

**Legacy Text:**
> "An Athlete Roster report from SwimTopia in Team Manager format must be submitted by each GPSA team to `rosters@gpsaswimming.org`."

**Resolution:**

- Rulebook focuses on the rule (what must be done): rosters must be submitted one week prior to season start

- This keeps the rulebook stable while allowing operational procedures to evolve

**New Rulebook Coverage:** eligibility-and-rosters.md item 4 under "Roster Requirements" (placeholder note removed)

---

**Legacy Text:**
> "A Rules Committee shall consist of three members and two alternates: a chairman, two members, and two alternates who shall be appointed by the GPSA President. If possible, have a member from each division. This committee shall review the rules before each swimming season and recommend changes needed. Such recommendations shall be voted on by the GPSA Board of Directors and if approved, shall be incorporated into the existing rules. Recommended rules changes shall be submitted to the Rules Committee for consideration and recommendation to the GPSA Board of Directors. This committee shall have authority over any protest and shall render their resolution promptly, in writing, to the GPSA Representative involved and to the President of the GPSA. Such resolutions will be final. For the purpose of resolving any protest, a vote shall be taken of three members, none of whom shall be affiliated with the teams in question."

**Resolution:**

- Added new "Rules Committee" section to officials.md with Composition and Duties subsections
- All legacy content preserved: committee structure, appointment by President, division representation goal, annual review duty, rules change process, protest authority, conflict of interest
- Protest authority items were already partially covered in conduct-of-meets.md; this addition provides the governance context

**New Rulebook Coverage:** officials.md "Rules Committee" section (Composition and Duties)
