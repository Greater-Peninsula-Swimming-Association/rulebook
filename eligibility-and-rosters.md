# Eligibility and Rosters

This section establishes the requirements for swimmer eligibility and team roster management.

## Roster Requirements

1. Only a **Bona Fide Member** listed on their **Team**'s posted roster may compete in GPSA-scheduled meets.

2. Proof of a swimmer's eligibility must be provided by the **Team**'s GPSA Representative upon request by the Rules Committee.

3. Each **Team** must maintain an up-to-date roster of swimmers, coaches, and certified officials. This roster serves as the official record of certification and must list each official's name and their specific, current certification(s) (e.g., Referee, Starter, S&T Judge). The GPSA Representative is responsible for keeping the roster current throughout the season.

4. **Team** rosters must be submitted no later than one week prior to the start of the GPSA season. Failure to comply will result in a $25 fine payable to the GPSA.

5. No swimmer may appear on the roster of more than one **Team** simultaneously.

## Changing Teams

1. After the season begins, swimmers may only change **Team**s if they:

    a. Change permanent residence.

    b. Meet the eligibility requirements as a **Bona Fide Member** for the new **Team**.

2. **Exception for Disbanded Teams:** A swimmer who is a **Bona Fide Member** of a pool that has not fielded a team for the current season may swim for another **Team** for a grace period of one (1) year. If, after the one-year period, the home pool still does not have a team, the swimmer must meet the eligibility requirements as a **Bona Fide Member** for the new **Team**.

## Age Determination

1. A swimmer's competition age is determined based on their age as of June 1st of the current season. Swimmers born on June 1st are considered to have reached the older age for competition purposes.

## Roster Revisions

1. Roster revisions are allowed at any time during the season, provided they are:

    a. Published at least 24 hours prior to the start of a meet and notification is sent to the Rules Committee and the division email distribution list.

    b. Any swimmer removed from the roster after the roster deadline cannot be reinstated for the remainder of the season.

## Eligibility Challenges

1. GPSA Representatives may challenge the eligibility of any swimmer by submitting a written request to the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee shall render all decisions promptly in writing to the President of the GPSA and to the GPSA Representative(s) involved. An appeal of an eligibility decision may be made by the GPSA Representative involved to the Rules Committee Chairman within seven (7) days of the date of the decision letter. The Rules Committee shall render the final decision on all questions concerning eligibility.

## Ineligible Swimmers

1. A swimmer determined to be ineligible shall not be allowed to further represent their **Team**. If a swimmer's ineligibility is extended to previous meets during the current season, those meets shall be rescored to reflect the removal of the swimmer. Division standings and swimmer awards shall also be changed accordingly.
