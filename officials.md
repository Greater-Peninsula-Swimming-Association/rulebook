# Officials

This section outlines the roles, responsibilities, and certification requirements for officials at GPSA-sanctioned meets.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### GPSA Representative

1. Each team must designate a GPSA Representative who serves as the official point of contact and primary authority for that team before, during, and after a meet. The representative must be a **Bona Fide Member** of the pool they represent.

2. The Representative shall act as their team's voting member on the GPSA Board of Directors and is responsible for attending and participating in all league meetings.

3. Shall possess a thorough knowledge of all GPSA rules and be empowered to make binding decisions for their team on matters of rule interpretation and meet procedures, including agreeing with the opposing Representative and Meet Referee on any pre-meet rule modifications.

4. Has primary responsibility for their team's roster and the eligibility of all swimmers. This includes maintaining an accurate roster and ensuring all swimmers meet eligibility requirements.

5. Is responsible for ensuring their team provides its required complement of certified officials for each meet. This includes encouraging attendance at training clinics, verifying the certification status of officials (by checking clinic attendance or reviewing USA Swimming certification status), and appointing volunteers to fill empty positions at their discretion.

6. Is responsible for the overall conduct of their team's swimmers, coaches, and spectators. They shall assist the Meet Referee in resolving disciplinary issues as requested.

7. If a GPSA Representative serves in another official capacity during a meet (e.g., as a Starter or Stroke & Turn Judge), they must designate an alternate to handle the responsibilities of the Representative for the duration of the meet. The coach may not be designated as the alternate.

8. Shall sign and submit the GPSA Code of Conduct acknowledgment form, and ensure that all coaches sign the form. Signed forms must be submitted to the Rules Committee no later than seven (7) days before the team's first scheduled meet.

    a. Teams that fail to submit signed Code of Conduct forms by the deadline shall forfeit all scheduled meets until the required forms are received by the Rules Committee.

    b. A new Code of Conduct acknowledgment form must be submitted if the GPSA Representative changes or new coaches are added during the season.

9. Shall ensure that the team's SwimTopia registration includes the GPSA Code of Conduct agreement clause as a required element for parents and guardians.

### Meet Referee

1. Shall have full authority over all officials on deck, shall assign and instruct them in order to provide fair and adequate coverage of the pool, enforce all rules and shall assure a fair and friendly meet under the rules of GPSA. He/she can overrule any meet official on a judgment decision. He/she has responsibility to address any question raised by either GPSA Representative or their duly appointed alternate with regard to the conduct of the meet. On a point of rule modification the referee shall defer to the judgment of both GPSA Representatives.

2. See the Place Recording procedures in the Conduct of Interpool Meets section for detailed process.

### Timers

1. **Head Timer** — Assure the assignment of Lane Timers to lanes. On the starting signal, start a watch(es) on every race. The time of this watch shall be used if a Lane Timer's watch fails.

2. **Lane Timer** — Officials assigned as Lane Timers may simultaneously operate two dissimilar devices (one watch and one button) but not two similar devices (two watches or two buttons). It is not within the Lane Timer's jurisdiction to judge if the swimmer's touch conforms to the applicable finish rules or if a relay take-off infraction has occurred. Each timer shall:

    a. Be in position at the start to have an unobstructed view and shall start the watch at the instant of observing the visual starting signal. If the visual starting signal is not observed, the watch shall be started upon hearing the starting signal.

    b. Stand directly over the assigned lane at the finish to observe a touch above, at, or below the surface of the water and stop the watch and/or push the semi-automatic system button when any part of the swimmer's body touches the wall.

    c. Report the watch time to the designated recorder, report if a late or missed pad touch is observed; and, if requested, present the watch for inspection. Lane Timers shall not clear their watches until a command to "clear watches" is given or the Referee signals that the next heat is ready to start.

### Scorekeepers

1. Sit at the scorekeepers' table and record on Meet Maestro the finish times of each swimmer, order of finish, disqualifications (as noted by signed DQ slips), and maintain a running record of the score.

    a. If two timers are used, the times must be averaged. If three timers are used, the middle time must be used.

    b. The order of finish must be entered for each scoring heat and match the Place Judge Form.

2. In the event of any questions regarding place, time, or disqualification for an event, or order of relays, he/she shall immediately notify the referee and wait for resolution.

3. Only the Referee, GPSA Representatives, Scorekeepers, and Timing Equipment Operator (if using a digital timing system) shall have access to Meet Maestro after the meet has begun.

4. After the meet has begun, the scorekeeper shall accept changes only in accordance with the substitution rules outlined in the Conduct of Interpool Meets section.

5. See the Post-Meet Procedures in the Conduct of Interpool Meets section for meet artifact handling responsibilities.

### Coaches

1. Shall stay in the area designated for his/her team and help to ensure that swim team members do not crowd the course or disrupt the officiating.

2. Are responsible for declaring all entries in SwimTopia and ensuring that all exhibition entries are flagged as such. See the Pre-Meet Requirements in the Conduct of Interpool Meets section for entry deadlines.

3. Are responsible for seeing that each swimmer behind the blocks and waiting to swim has, if used, a properly completed lane slip; i.e., event name and number, lane assignment, first and last name (same as listed on the roster sheet) of swimmer and order of swimmers in relays.

4. May make substitutions in accordance with the substitution rules outlined in the Conduct of Interpool Meets section.

5. Are responsible for the conduct of their respective team.

### Relay Take-Off Judges

1. Relay take-off judges shall be assigned by the Referee (one from each **Team**) and shall stand so that they can clearly see both the feet of the departing swimmer(s) as they leave the starting platform and the touch of the incoming swimmer(s), and shall judge whether the swimmer is in contact with the platform when the incoming swimmer touches the end of the pool. The judges shall independently report infractions in writing without the use of the infraction hand signal. A relay will be disqualified only if the same infraction has been confirmed by both judges.

### Marshal(s) (Optional)

1. Shall wear identifying attire and enforce warm-up procedures and maintain order in the swimming venue. The Marshal shall have full authority to warn or order to cease and desist, and, with the concurrence of the Referee, to remove, or have removed from the swimming venue anyone behaving in an unsafe manner or using profane or abusive language, or whose actions are disrupting the orderly conduct of the meet.

### Timing Equipment Operator (Optional)

1. The Timing Equipment Operator shall be responsible for the automatic or semi-automatic timing equipment, including the electronic starting system and scoreboard (if used), and shall advise the Referee or GPSA Representative of any system problems that might affect the accuracy of times. The timing equipment should be placed so that the operator is able to observe the finish of each race.

2. When automatic timing equipment is used without backup stopwatches, the Timing Equipment Operator may fulfill the duties of the Head Timer, and a separate Head Timer is not required.
